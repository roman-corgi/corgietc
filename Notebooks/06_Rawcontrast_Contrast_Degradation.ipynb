        "Contrast degradation is a user-inputted argument in `corgietc.py`. It is a multiplier of rawcontrast (the contrast stability value of the observed Planet), and it scales the value of rawcontrast by a specific factor. Thus, a `contrast_degradation` factor of 0.5 reduces rawcontrast to the 50% of its initial value, contrast degradation of 0.25 reduces rawcontrast to 25%, contrast degradation of 2 increases rawcontrast twice, etc.\n",

At the the same time, C_b changes greatly with a changing `contrast_degradation` input.\n",
