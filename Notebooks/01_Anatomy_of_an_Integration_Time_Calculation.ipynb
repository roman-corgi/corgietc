    "The Roman Coronagraph Exposure Time Calculator (ETC; ``corgietc``) is implemented by integrating two Python packages: ``cgi_noise`` and ``EXOSIMS``.  ``cgi_noise`` provides detailed modeling of the Roman Coronagraph and the definitions of the Roman Coronagraph observing modes (scenarios), along with basic models for astrophysical inputs.  ``EXOSIMS`` is a mission modeling framework, and provides its own ETCs, along with detailed astrophysical models and other useful utilities.  ``corgietc`` links these two packages together by implementing an ``EXOSIMS`` ``OpticalSystem`` implementation that calls ``cgi_noise`` for various calculations. This allows us to use the ``cgi_noise`` instrument model with the various inputs that can be computed by ``EXOSIMS``."

    "## Required Inputs for Computing Integration Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-source integration time calculations are provided by the `calc_intTime` method of an `EXOSIMS` `OpticalSystem` module (such as ``corgietc``).  This method takes 7 required inputs and one optional one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An `EXOSIMS` `TargetList` object: this includes all information about the targets (stars) that you might want to observe, along with utilities for computing stellar photometry.  Details on the `TargetList` class are available here: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targetlist.html and details on the stellar photometric modeling are available here: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#photometry\n",
    "2. The specific subset of targets you wish to compute integration times for (`sInds`).  `TargetList` stores all stellar information in equally-sized arrays, so this input is an array (or list, or other iterable) of which target indices you wish to select.  If your `TargetList` only contains one target, this input would be 0.\n",
    "3. The surface brightness of local zodiacal light to assume for the calculation (`fZ`).  This must be an `astropy` `Quantity` object (https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html) whose contents are an array of either size 1 (in which case the same value is used for all calculations) or of an equal size to the `sInds` input. The units must be consistent with arcsec$^{-2}$. For details on the local zodiacal light model, see: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#zodiacal-light\n",
    "4. The intensity of the exo-zodiacal light to assume for the calculation (`JEZ`).  This must be structured in the same way as the `fZ` input, but with units consistent with photons s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. For details on the exo-zodiacal light model, see: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#exozodiacal-light\n",
    "5. The desired $\\Delta$magnitude between planet and star you wish to reach (`dMag`).  This must be an iterable of either size 1 (same for all calculations) or of equal size to `sInds`. This value sets the integration depth you wish to achieve.\n",
    "6. The angular separation at which to perform calculations.  Because coronagraph performance varies as a function of angular separation, we must specify where in the throughput/contrast/etc. curves we wish to take our coronagraph performance values from.  That location is specified by this input, which must be an `astropy` `Quantity` array (with the same dimensionality assumptions as the other inputs) with units compatible with arcseconds. For more information on the parametrization of coronagraph performance, see here: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opticalsystem.html#standardized-coronagraph-parameters. Note that for the Roman coronagraph, we do **not** parametrize by stellar angular diameter - the assumption is that all of our target stars are fully unresolved.\n",
    "7. The observing mode/scenario (`mode`).  An observing mode is the combination of a specific coronagraph with a specific detector in a specific bandpass.  It also defines the target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that you wish to achieve for your observation.  More details here: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opticalsystem.html#optical-system-definition\n",
    "8. (Optional) An `EXOSIMS` `TimeKeeping` object.  As the name implies, a `TimeKeeping` object tracks elapsed mission time (amongst other time-associated utilities.  Time-on-orbit is an input into the integration time because we have a degradation model for our detector, which attempts to predict performance changes due to radiation exposure over the length of the mission.  If omitted, ``corgietc`` automatically assumes 21 months at L2. Note that the degradation model implemented by ``cgi_noise`` is only valid out to 63 months - past that, we cannot really trust the results."

In order to do this properly, we need to define a new `TargetList` object with the magnitude we want.
